Currently, the compare page is a placeholder with upload areas but no actual comparison functionality for previously analyzed apps.\n\n## 2. **Solution**\nReplace the existing placeholder compare page with a fully functional comparison tool that allows users to select 2-4 previously analyzed apps, displays them in a matrix view (features as rows, apps as columns), generates AI-powered insights about similarities and differences, saves comparisons to Supabase, and exports results as markdown.\n\n## 3. **Acceptance Criteria**\n\n- **GIVEN** a user has previously analyzed apps, **WHEN** they visit the compare page, **THEN** they can select 2-4 apps from a multi-select dropdown showing app icons and names\n\n- **GIVEN** the user has selected 2-4 apps, **WHEN** the comparison view loads, **THEN** a matrix view displays features as rows and apps as columns with shared features highlighted differently from unique features\n\n- **GIVEN** the comparison is generated, **WHEN** the user views the results, **THEN** they see AI-generated insights about design patterns, colors, typography, and feature similarities/differences\n\n- **GIVEN** a comparison is complete, **WHEN** the user clicks \"Save Comparison\", **THEN** the comparison data is saved to the Supabase app_comparisons table\n\n- **GIVEN** a comparison is complete, **WHEN** the user clicks \"Export as Markdown\", **THEN** a markdown file is downloaded containing the full comparison report\n\n## 4. **Files to Modify**\n\n| File | Purpose | Action |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| `app/compare/page.tsx` | Main compare page with app selection and comparison display | modify |\n| `components/ComparisonTable.tsx` | Matrix view component showing features vs apps | create |\n| `components/AppSelector.tsx` | Multi-select dropdown for selecting analyzed apps | create |\n| `lib/comparison.ts` | Comparison logic and markdown export utilities | create |\n| `app/api/compare/route.ts` | API route for generating AI-powered comparison insights | create |\n| `types/analyze.ts` | Already has `AppComparison` type, may need minor updates | modify |\n\n## 5. **Implementation Tasks**\n\n```tasks\n- [ ] T001: Create AppSelector component with multi-select dropdown | File: components/AppSelector.tsx\n- [ ] T002: Create ComparisonTable component with matrix view | File: components/ComparisonTable.tsx\n- [ ] T003: Create comparison utility functions and markdown export | File: lib/comparison.ts\n- [ ] T004: Create API route for AI-powered comparison generation | File: app/api/compare/route.ts\n- [ ] T005: Update compare page with full comparison functionality | File: app/compare/page.tsx\n- [ ] T006: Add comparison insights section with Claude integration | File: components/ComparisonTable.tsx\n```\n\n## 6. **Verification**\n\n1. Navigate to `/compare` page with at least 2 analyzed apps in the database\n2. Verify AppSelector shows all analyzed apps with icons and names\n3. Select 2-4 apps and verify matrix comparison table renders correctly\n4. Confirm shared features are highlighted green, unique features highlighted with app-specific colors\n5. Verify \"Save Comparison\" saves to Supabase and shows success message\n6. Verify \"Export as Markdown\" downloads a properly formatted markdown file\n7. Test that AI insights are generated and displayed for the selected apps",
